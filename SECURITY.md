## Reporting a Vulnerability

First of all, we kindly ask you to **not disclose about the detail of the vulnerability** to the public before we have implemented a working fix that covers the particular vulnerability to protect our users from 0day attacks.

If you found a vulnerability in particular, the **`widget-frontend`** repository, please do one of the following with your convenience:
- [File a Security Advisory Report (recommended)](https://github.com/penguin-statistics/widget-frontend/security/advisories/new) (that will privately disclose the vulnerability to the moderators of this organization)
- Contact the maintainer of this repository, Galvin Gao, at `me at galvingao dot com`
- Contact the webmaster and organizer of the Penguin Statistics organization, Alviss Reimu, at (`alvissreimu at gmail`).

Thanks in advance for making Penguin Statistics a better and safer site for everyone! ;)
